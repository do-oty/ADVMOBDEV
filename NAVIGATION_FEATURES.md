# Navigation Features Implementation

This document outlines the three navigation features implemented in the Spotify app:

## 1. Gestures Implementation ✅

### Features Implemented:
- **Swipe-to-open/close drawer navigation**: Swipe from left edge to open drawer, swipe right to close
- **Tap-to-select on Playlists screen**: Interactive playlist selection with visual feedback
- **Gesture sensitivity adjustment**: Set `minDistance: 20` for swipe detection
- **GestureHandlerRootView**: Wraps the entire app for gesture support

### Key Components:
- `CustomDrawer.tsx`: Custom drawer with gesture support
- `DrawerContent.tsx`: Drawer menu content
- `Playlists.tsx`: Interactive playlists screen with tap-to-select

### Gesture Controls:
- **Swipe Right**: Opens drawer (minDistance: 20px)
- **Swipe Left**: Closes drawer
- **Tap Playlist**: Shows selection dialog with options

## 2. Custom Transitions Implementation ✅

### Features Implemented:
- **Slide transition (300ms)**: Profile/Settings screens slide from right
- **Fade transition (200ms)**: Sign-up screen fades in/out
- **Drawer scale animation**: Content scales to 0.9 when drawer opens
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth, native performance animations

### Key Components:
- `CustomTransitions.tsx`: Transition configurations
- `CustomDrawer.tsx`: Animated drawer with scale effect
- Updated `_layout.tsx`: Applied transitions to specific screens

### Transition Types:
- **Slide from Right**: Profile screen (300ms)
- **Fade**: SignUp screen (200ms)
- **Scale**: Drawer content (300ms)

## 3. Navigation Persistence Implementation ✅

### Features Implemented:
- **AsyncStorage integration**: Saves navigation state locally
- **State restoration**: Returns to last visited screen on app launch
- **Drawer state persistence**: Remembers if drawer was open/closed
- **Edge case handling**: Invalid state defaults to Home screen
- **State expiry**: Navigation state expires after 24 hours

### Key Components:
- `useNavigationPersistence.ts`: Custom hook for state management
- `NavigationContext.tsx`: Context for global navigation state
- `LoadingScreen.tsx`: Loading screen during state restoration

### Persistence Features:
- **Auto-save**: Saves state on every navigation change
- **Auto-restore**: Restores state on app launch
- **State validation**: Checks for expired or invalid states
- **Fallback handling**: Defaults to Signin screen if no valid state

## Installation & Setup

### Dependencies Added:
```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### Babel Configuration:
```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
};
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Gestures:
1. Open the app and navigate to Home
2. Swipe from left edge to open drawer
3. Navigate to Playlists tab
4. Tap on any playlist to test selection
5. Swipe right to close drawer

### 2. Test Transitions:
1. Navigate to SignUp screen (fade transition)
2. Navigate to Profile screen (slide transition)
3. Open drawer to see scale animation

### 3. Test Persistence:
1. Navigate to any screen and open/close drawer
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app - it should return to the last screen
4. Check if drawer state is preserved

## File Structure

```

├── Profile.tsx                 # Profile screen with slide transition

## Performance Notes

- All animations use `react-native-reanimated` for 60fps performance
- Gesture handling is optimized with proper `minDistance` settings
- Navigation state is debounced to prevent excessive saves
- AsyncStorage operations are non-blocking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Gestures not working**: Ensure `GestureHandlerRootView` wraps the app
2. **Transitions not smooth**: Check babel.config.js has reanimated plugin
3. **Persistence not working**: Verify AsyncStorage is properly installed
4. **Drawer not opening**: Check gesture sensitivity settings

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test navigation persistence
node scripts/test-navigation.js

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Clear AsyncStorage (if needed)
# Use React Native Debugger or device settings
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add haptic feedback for gestures
- Implement more transition types
- Add navigation analytics
- Support for deep linking with persistence
- Offline navigation state backup
